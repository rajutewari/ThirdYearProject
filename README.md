# Car Parking Sensor


This is a third year project. It is in it's prototype stage. This project is about creating a car parking sensor in which it'll provide real time data to the user, via an app, indicating whether or not a car park spot is available. This type of 'car park availabilty' is available in shopping malls but not out on public roads hence this project aims to fix that everyday problem. As well as that, this project will aim to implement neural network so that the software will be able to predicate if a spot will be occupied at a certain moment in the future.

The hardware is built using an Arduino Uno and an ESP8266 12-E module.
Technology stack is:
 - Spring Boot + Tomcat
 - Java
 - Maven
 - MongoDB
